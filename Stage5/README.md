# **Cervical Cancer Multi-Omics Analysis: Methylation and Gene Expression Integration**
## **Overview**

This repository contains materials related to our project on integrating DNA methylation and gene expression data for cervical cancer research. The goal of this study is to identify potential biomarkers by analyzing differentially methylated CpG sites and their associated differentially expressed genes. Through network and functional enrichment analysis, we highlight the hub genes that play a crucial role in cervical cancer pathogenesis, which could serve as therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers.
